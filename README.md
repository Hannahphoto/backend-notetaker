# Notes

To accomplish this project I used W3 (https://www.w3schools.com/) schools to help find the syntax of different call backs and fucntions. I also seeked help from Ask BCS and a tutor seesion with Corrado Alfano. Corrado was very helpful. Most of the tutors give you the answer straight up but Corrado helps you think and try and find the answer yourself. Very helpful. I also had to seek help in office hours because i would break my code. I accomplished the Delete call on my own however i ended up breaking it and and had to seek help to finilize the project. Interesting project.
